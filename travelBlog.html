            Nestled in the Rasdhoo Atoll of the Maldives, the Kuramathi Island Resort offers what can only be 
            described as an indulgent island escape. To set the stall out early: I am not the target customer for
            a resort holiday. While I had experienced a hotel resort once before for work reasons, a trip to the 
            Maldives to stay at a luxury establishment felt somewhat alien to me. More familiar with metropolis 
            surroundings and the sense of control and freedom that comes with a city break, I entered a trip to the
            Indian Ocean with a slight feeling of trepidation. However, the undeniable feeling of excitement and 
            pleasure of experiencing a luxurious resort like Kuramathi was something else, and the impeccable service, 
            pristine natural surroundings, and eco-conscious initiatives changed my outlook on certain elements of 
            traditional travel.

            The resort is surrounded by turquoise waters and pristine white-sand beaches,
            making it the perfect setting for a tropical escape, with travel time an estimated 
            60 minutes by speedboat from Male airport. Kuramathi offers a range of accommodations, including beach villas, 
            pool villas, and overwater bungalows – to which we made our home for the week.

            Docking at a wooden jetty and greeted with warm hospitality from the moment I stepped foot on the island,
            I was immediately overcome with varying emotions that ranged from the surreal to the sublime. For anybody 
            like me that isn’t particularly familiar with luxury escapes, you begin to feel rather overcome by the 
            otherworldly surroundings – no matter their significance. As we walked toward the reception, surrounded by
            white sand, coconut trees and the welcoming smiles of the staff, a pelican swooped beside me and snatched up a 
            tropical fish lunch. It’s moments like these, in which very few around me batted an eye, that compound the 
            magnificence of the location.

            Given the social climate of travel, and the economic
             challenges that come with the desire to remain as sustainable as possible, 
             the light is undoubtedly shining on the Maldives. One of the few locations in the world with 
             a thriving reef and reliance on nature for their travel industry, modern approaches are attempting 
             to sustain a level of respect for natural surroundings. With that, Kuramathi has implemented a range 
             of eco-friendly initiatives, including a coral reef rehabilitation program, a desalination plant, and 
             a waste management system. Guests can learn more about these initiatives through educational tours 
             and activities, with the eco-centre sitting slap-bang in the middle of the island, offering talks and 
             guidance on sustainable practices. The resort’s commitment to sustainability was also evident throughout 
             our stay. We learned about the resort’s coral reef rehabilitation program, which highlighted its dedication 
             to preserving the natural beauty of the Maldives. It’s hard not to be impressed by the self-sustainability 
             efforts of the resort and its efforts to minimise its impact on the environment while still providing guests 
             with a luxurious experience.

            With this being a resort experience, food and drink come as part of the deal. With structured offerings that range in price and availability, one of the standout features of the Kuramathi is its dining options. The resort has 12 restaurants and bars, each with its own unique menu and atmosphere. While the buffet restaurants come as part of the basic package, the à la carte establishments are open to all at an extra cost. Guests can enjoy everything from seafood and Asian cuisine to Italian and Mediterranean dishes, with options for every taste and preference.

The resort also offers a range of activities and experiences, including snorkelling, diving, spa treatments, and cultural tours. While these activities will undoubtedly be found across most resorts, the ease at which Kuramathi makes them available to guests is undeniably impressive. With snorkelling trips available to neighbouring islands, it offers a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to swim with sharks and turtles.

While I may have had some trepidation to begin with, Kuramathi is a luxurious and unforgettable resort that offers something for everyone. Whether you’re looking for a romantic escape, a family vacation, or a solo adventure, the resort’s stunning location, exceptional service, and world-class amenities will ensure an unforgettable trip. For anyone seeking an indulgent island escape with a conscience, Kuramathi offers exceptional dining options and eco-friendly initiatives, making it the perfect choice for travellers who value sustainability and responsible tourism.
