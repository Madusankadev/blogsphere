            Hi everyone! We are CodeFive, and for today's project, we're going
            to build MechaMaven: The Educational Robot Explorer. But hey, you
            might be wondering, Earl, how can you claim that this is an
            educational robot? Well, I specifically designed this for
            educational purposes. It has 10 output pins to connect 10 sensors or
            an LCD. It also has 2 output pins for the I2C interface. It includes
            4 motor drivers to operate 4 motors, with the option to add up to 6
            servo motors. Also, it is equipped with a passive buzzer to play
            music, and much more! This robot can be controlled using a PS3
            controller, a mobile phone, and a computer. But for today's video,
            we are going to focus on controlling this robot using a PS3
            controller.
